# final-project-DNS-Tunnel-DoH-Classification-

Final research project, 

The project contains two parts,
Phase One-
DNS tunneling - malicious software that allows information exfiltration in a client-server model.
The information is transmitted over DNS queries that use the DOH (DNS Over HTTPS) protocol while encrypting the data , issuing an SSL certificate, documenting the data and classifying it.

Phase two-
Consists of a two-stage classification machine KNN (K-nearest neighbors algorithm), which classifies the data.
First stage - NON-DOH | DOH classification.
Second stage - malicious DOH | Legit DOH classification.

final results - Classification with an accuracy of 95% on average.
